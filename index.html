<p>About Me
A short bio.
My résumé &amp; publications.
I am @clattner_llvm on Twitter.
I am not a web designer.
Apple
I have worked for Apple since 2005, holding a number of different positions over the years (a partial history is available in the Apple section of my résumé). These days, I run the Developer Tools department, which is responsible for Xcode and Instruments, as well as compilers, debuggers, and related tools.</p>

<p>To answer a FAQ: Yes, I do still write code and most of it goes to llvm.org. However, due to the nature of the work, I usually can't talk about it until a couple of years after it happens. :)</p>

<p>Swift
I started work on the Swift Programming Language (wikipedia) in July of 2010. I implemented much of the basic language structure, with only a few people knowing of its existence. A few other (amazing) people started contributing in earnest late in 2011, and it became a major focus for the Apple Developer Tools group in July 2013.</p>

<p>The Swift language is the product of tireless effort from a team of language experts, documentation gurus, compiler optimization ninjas, and an incredibly important internal dogfooding group who provided feedback to help refine and battle-test ideas. Of course, it also greatly benefited from the experiences hard-won by many other languages in the field, drawing ideas from Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, CLU, and far too many others to list.</p>

<p>The Xcode Playgrounds feature and REPL were a personal passion of mine, to make programming more interactive and approachable. The Xcode and LLDB teams have done a phenomenal job turning crazy ideas into something truly great. Playgrounds were heavily influenced by Bret Victor's ideas, by Light Table and by many other interactive systems. I hope that by making programming more approachable and fun, we'll appeal to the next generation of programmers and to help redefine how Computer Science is taught.</p>

<p>Compilers
I lead and am the original author of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, an open source umbrella project that includes all sorts of toolchain related technology: compilers, debuggers, JIT systems, optimizers, static analysis systems, etc. I started both LLVM and Clang and am still the individual with the most commits. Of course, as the community has grown, my contribution is being dwarfed by those from a wide range of really amazing folks.</p>

<p>LLVM has enjoyed broad industry success - being widely used in commercial products - as well supporting hundreds of academic papers. For its contribution to the software industry, LLVM has been recognized with the ACM Software System Award.</p>
